                        In this project, I tried to create an MVC model my self for proper structuring.<br><br>
                        I added database functions (queries) in classes/Book.php<br><br>
                        The main configurations are in config/main_config.php<br><br>
                        The RESTful APIs are in apis/apihandling.php<br><br>
                        All images are inside the folder img<br><br>
                        All css files are inside the folder css<br><br>
                        All js files are inside the folder js<br><br>
                        The main view files are index.php, createbook.php, updatebook.php, deletebook.php,
                        retrievebook.php, searchbook.php, allbooks.php and details.php <br><br>
                        I seperated header and footer part of the pages as header.php and footer.php <br>
                    
                        
                    </p>
                </div></div>
